## Security Best Practices
- **Keep Dependencies Up to Date**: Regularly update project dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Use Strong Authentication**: Enable two-factor authentication for repository access.
- **Limit Access**: Only grant access to contributors who need it for their roles.
- **Review Code Changes**: Use pull requests for code changes and conduct code reviews to identify potential security issues.

## Secure Coding Practices
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Never hard-code sensitive data (like passwords or API keys) in your codebase. Use environment variables instead.
- **Logging**: Implement logging practices that do not expose sensitive information.
